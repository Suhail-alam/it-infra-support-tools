# Windows Endpoint Health Check

Basic checklist I use while troubleshooting or handing over a Windows laptop/desktop.

- Check disk space on C: drive.
- Confirm Windows updates status.
- Verify antivirus/EDR is installed and running.
- Check network connectivity (ping gateway / DNS).
- Test VPN connection and common internal resources.
- Verify user can sign in with domain/AAD account.
- Confirm required apps are installed (Office, browser, VPN, etc.).
- Check OneDrive/SharePoint sync (if used).
- Test printer and default printer setting.
- Note any hardware issues (battery, keyboard, display).
