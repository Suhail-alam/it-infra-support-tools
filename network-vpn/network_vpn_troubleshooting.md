# Network & VPN Troubleshooting

Basic checks I follow when users report network or VPN issues.

- Check if user is connected to any network (Wi‑Fi/LAN).
- Verify IP address and gateway (ipconfig, ping gateway).
- Test DNS resolution (ping a website by name and by IP).
- Check if only specific apps are failing (browser, Outlook, VPN client).
- Ask if issue happens on other networks (home vs office vs mobile hotspot).
- For VPN:
  - Confirm username/password are correct.
  - Check VPN profile/server address is correct.
  - Verify internet works before starting VPN.
  - Note exact error code/message from VPN client.
- If required, collect basic logs/screenshots and update ticket clearly.
